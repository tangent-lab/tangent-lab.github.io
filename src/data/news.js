    We are proud to share that two projects from Tangent Lab were recognized at the 2025 CS Diversity Awards, celebrating initiatives that advance diversity, inclusion, equity, and justice in computing science.


    
    <div class="text-xl font-medium"> 🥇 Joint Winner: Intelligent Guiding Robot System for Blind and Visually Impaired People Enabling Independent Navigation </div> 
    Team Members: Qihan Gao, Shaojun Cai, Kwek Bin Chong
    Advisors: Lawrence Kim, David Hsu

    This project developed an intelligent navigation assistant system for robotic guide platforms, integrating a voice interface, reasoning backbone for planning and decision-making, and modular functions such as object detection, text reading, and environmental description. Deployed on a quadruped robot, the system enables users to navigate complex public environments with greater autonomy. Field tests demonstrate its potential to support blind users in performing everyday tasks more independently. This work exemplifies how advanced AI and robotics can be developed to support inclusive design, ensuring that emerging technologies are accessible and empowering for everyone.


    <div class="text-xl font-medium"> 🎉 Finalist: Facilitating Bids for Conversation Entry using ConvoBuddy, A Chatbot Conversation Assistant  </div>     
    Team Members: Sarah Jade Pratt, Kenny Zhang
    Advisor: Xing-Dong Yang

    Facilitating smooth entry into ongoing conversations is essential for fostering inclusive and enjoyable social interactions, yet it remains one of the most challenging aspects of conversational dynamics. This project presents ConvoBuddy, a novel conversational assistant designed to support users actively seeking to join existing conversational groups based upon a preliminary need-finding user study and literature review.


    Congratulations to both teams for their outstanding contributions to promoting inclusivity in computing science!

    description: "Samira gave a talk about her latest research at ASSETS 2024 conference. Individuals with ADHD grapple with elevated stress levels, emotional regulation challenges, and difficulty sustaining focus. Fidgeting, a behavior traditionally frowned upon, has been shown to help people with ADHD in concentration, emotional and mental state management, and energy regulation. However, traditional fidgeting devices have limited fixed affordances providing cookie-cutter style fidgeting experience to all despite individual differences. Recognizing the uniqueness of individual fidgeting tendencies, we use small tabletop robots to provide a customizable fidgeting interaction experience and conduct co-design sessions with 16 adults diagnosed with ADHD to explore how they envision their fidgeting interactions being changed with these programmable robots. We examine core elements defining a successful fidgeting interaction with robots, assess the significance of customizability in these interactions and any common trends among participants, and investigate additional advantages that interactions with robots may offer. This research reveals nuanced preferences of adults with ADHD concerning robot-assisted fidgeting.",
