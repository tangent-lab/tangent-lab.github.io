    <div class="text-lg font-medium"> 🏅 Honorable Mention Award: User-Defined Co-Speech Gesture Design with Swarm Robots</div> 
    Minh Duc Dang, Samira Pulatova, and Lawrence Kim

    Non-verbal signals, including co-speech gestures, play a vital role in human communication by conveying nuanced meanings beyond verbal discourse. While researchers have explored co-speech gestures in human-like conversational agents, limited attention has been given to non-humanoid alternatives. In this paper, we propose using swarm robotic systems as conversational agents and introduce a foundational set of swarm-based co-speech gestures, elicited from non-technical users and validated through an online study. This work outlines the key software and hardware requirements to advance research in co-speech gesture generation with swarm robots, contributing to the future development of social robotics and conversational agents.

    <div class="text-lg font-medium"> 🪄 DiminishAR: Diminishing Visual Distractions via Holographic AR Displays  </div> 
    JangHyeon Lee and Lawrence Kim
    
    Smartphones are integral to modern life, yet research highlights the cognitive drawbacks associated with their mere presence. While physically removing them can mitigate these effects, it is often inconvenient and may heighten anxiety due to prolonged separation. To address this, we use holographic augmented reality (AR) displays to visually diminish distractions with two interventions: 1) Visual Camouflage, which disguises the smartphone with a hologram that matches its size and blends with the background, making it less noticeable, and 2) Visual Substitution, which occludes the smartphone with a contextually relevant hologram, like books on a desk. In a study with 60 participants, we compared cognitive performance with the smartphone nearby, remote, and visually diminished by our AR interventions. Our findings show that the interventions significantly reduce cognitive impairment, with effects comparable to physically removing the smartphone. The adaptability of our approach opens new avenues to manage visual distractions in daily life.

    <div class="text-lg font-medium"> 🆙 Co-Design & Evaluation of Visual Interventions for Head Posture Correction in Virtual Reality Games </div> 
    Minh Duc Dang, Duy Phuoc Luong, Christopher Napier, and Lawrence Kim 

    While virtual reality (VR) games offer immersive experiences, prolonged improper head posture during VR gaming sessions can cause neck discomfort and injuries. To address this issue, we prototyped a framework to detect instances of improper head posture and apply various visual interventions to correct them. After assessing the prototype's usability in a co-design workshop with participants experienced in VR design and kinesiology, we refined the interventions in two main directions --- using explicit visual indicators or employing implicit background changes. The refined interventions were subsequently tested in a controlled experiment involving a target selection task. The study results demonstrate that the interventions effectively helped participants maintain better head posture during VR gameplay compared to the control condition.

    This project developed an intelligent navigation assistant system for robotic guide platforms, integrating a voice interface, reasoning backbone for planning and decision-making, and modular functions such as object detection, text reading, and environmental description. Deployed on a quadruped robot, the system enables users to navigate complex public environments with greater autonomy. Field tests demonstrate its potential to support blind users in performing everyday tasks more independently. This work exemplifies how advanced AI and robotics can be developed to support inclusive design, ensuring that emerging technologies are accessible and empowering for everyone.

    Facilitating smooth entry into ongoing conversations is essential for fostering inclusive and enjoyable social interactions, yet it remains one of the most challenging aspects of conversational dynamics. This project presents ConvoBuddy, a novel conversational assistant designed to support users actively seeking to join existing conversational groups based upon a preliminary need-finding user study and literature review.


    Congratulations to both teams for their outstanding contributions to promoting inclusivity in computing science!

Individuals with ADHD grapple with elevated stress levels, emotional regulation challenges, and difficulty sustaining focus. Fidgeting, a behavior traditionally frowned upon, has been shown to help people with ADHD in concentration, emotional and mental state management, and energy regulation. However, traditional fidgeting devices have limited fixed affordances providing cookie-cutter style fidgeting experience to all despite individual differences. Recognizing the uniqueness of individual fidgeting tendencies, we use small tabletop robots to provide a customizable fidgeting interaction experience and conduct co-design sessions with 16 adults diagnosed with ADHD to explore how they envision their fidgeting interactions being changed with these programmable robots. We examine core elements defining a successful fidgeting interaction with robots, assess the significance of customizability in these interactions and any common trends among participants, and investigate additional advantages that interactions with robots may offer. This research reveals nuanced preferences of adults with ADHD concerning robot-assisted fidgeting.",
