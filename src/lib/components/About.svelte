            We focus on creating affective, tangible interfaces that enable
            meaningful interaction with technology while promoting physical and
            mental well-being. By leveraging human abilities like spatial
            cognition, emotional connection, we develop cutting-edge systems
            that bridge the digital and physical worlds.

            Our research spans interactive tangible displays, haptic interfaces,
            and AI-powered tools to enhance remote collaboration, creative
            design, education, therapy, and accessibility.

          <div>
            Guided by iterative prototyping, human-centered design, and studies
            on human perception, we aim to shape the future of how people
            interact with technology.
