            The SFU Tangent Lab, led by Prof. Lawrence Kim, explores how emerging technologies can foster more affective and tangible interactions, empowering individuals toward self-actualization. We believe that human-centered interfaces should seamlessly bridge the digital and physical worlds, leveraging innate abilities such as spatial cognition and emotional connection.

            Our research combines human-computer interaction, robotics, haptics, AR/VR, and AI to develop novel interaction systems. Specifically, we create interactive tangible displays, haptic interfaces, immersive AR/VR environments, and AI-powered tools designed to enhance physical and mental well-being, remote collaboration, productivity, creativity, education, therapy, and accessibility. To achieve these goals, we employ an iterative prototyping and human-centered design approach, while conducting user studies to deepen our understanding of human perception and interaction.
